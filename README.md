# 🚀 Project – Embedded System (LPC21xx)

## 📌 Project Title  
**Time-Stamped Sensor Monitoring & Alert System**

---

## 📖 Project Description  
This project is a complete **embedded system solution** developed using **Embedded C** on the **LPC21xx ARM microcontroller platform**.  
It is designed to monitor real-time sensor data, process it using ADC, attach time-stamps using RTC, display information on LCD, and generate alerts when predefined threshold conditions are crossed.

The system integrates multiple peripherals such as:
- Temperature sensor (**LM35**)
- Real-Time Clock (**RTC**)
- LCD display
- Keypad
- UART communication
- ADC module
- Alert system (LED/Buzzer)

This project demonstrates **real-time data acquisition, processing, user interaction, and alert generation**, making it suitable for:
- Academic mini-projects  
- Embedded system learning  
- Real-time monitoring applications  
- IoT foundation systems
